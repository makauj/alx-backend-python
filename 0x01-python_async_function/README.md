### `Async` and `await` syntax

1. What is Asynchronous programming?

Asynchronous programming allows you to write a program that performs non-blocking operations. This means that your program can handle multiple tasks concurrently. This increases efficiency. With Asynchronous programming, your program does not need to wait for one task to complete before moving on to the next task.
